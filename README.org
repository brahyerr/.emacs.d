* NOTES
- I use i3bar.el for the statusbar. I have a custom block that runs =tail= on a fifo file for workspace information reported by exwm. If the bar is not active, but exwm is still reporting information, then _emacs will hang._
  - I've mitigated this by changing the report function to return nil if i3bar isnt running, but this is a somewhat fragile system.
    - On startup, make sure you are *focused* into an emacs window, then call =i3bar-mode= to start the statusbar. Afterwards, you should be able to freely disable/enable the statusbar by calling =i3bar-mode= again.
- Toggle window-divider-mode if I (you) have problems with the window divider being too large
